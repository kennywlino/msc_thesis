Abstract

Abstract—Various methods have recently appeared to transform foreign-accented speech into its native-accented counterpart. Eval-uation of these accent conversion methods requires extensive lis-tening tests across a number of perceptual dimensions. This article presents three objective measures that may be used to assess the acoustic quality, degree of foreign accent, and speaker identity of accent-converted utterances. Accent conversion generates novel ut-terances: those of a foreign speaker with a native accent. There-fore, the acoustic quality in accent conversion cannot be evaluated with conventional measures of spectral distortion, which assume that a clean recording of the speech signal is available for compar-ison. Here we evaluate a single-ended measure of speech quality, ITU-T recommendation P.563 for narrow-band telephony. We also propose a measure of foreign accent that exploits a weakness of automatic speech recognizers: their sensitivity to foreign accents. Namely, we use phoneme-level match scores given by the HTK rec-ognizer trained on a large number of English American speakers to obtain a measure of native accent. Finally, we propose a measure of speaker identity that projects acoustic vectors (e.g., Mel cep-stral, F0) onto the linear discriminant that maximizes separability for a given pair of source and target speakers. The three measures are evaluated on a corpus of accent-converted utterances that had been previously rated through perceptual tests. Our results show that the three measures have a high degree of correlation with their corresponding subjective ratings, suggesting that they may be used to accelerate the development of foreign-accent conversion tools. Applications of these measures in the context of computer assisted pronunciation training and voice conversion are also discussed. Index Terms—Accent conversion, foreign accent recognition, speaker recognition, voice conversion. I.
