Accent conversion (AC), the process of transforming the accent of one speaker as if they had the accent of another speaker, has been cited as a prospective solution for challenges faced in language learning and voice-based technologies. Works such as \textcite{aryal2014, zhao2018a} have found some success in using accent conversion to minimize the accents of various non-native speakers, while work such as \textcite{mohammadi2017} points to the multiple applications of voice conversion as a whole. Despite these works, accent conversion still remains a relatively new section of research, with plenty to be investigated. 

In this master's thesis, we detail previous research as related to accents by outlining important theories from the perspective of linguistics and provide details on how accent conversion arose as a prospective solution for language learning and voice-based technologies by discussing research in computer-assisted pronunciation training and automatic speech recognition systems. We then detail our experiments with accent conversion using a traditional Gaussian Mixture Model approach following \textcite{aryal2014} using the ARCTIC/L2-ARCTIC corpora to test non-native to native conversion, and the Accents of the British Isles (ABI) corpus to test conversion between two native, but distinct accents. We compare the performance of accent conversion between these two separate corpora by recruiting the help of outside evaluators to do a perceptual study. Through the perceptual study, we observe that the evaluators agree that the converted audios in both corpora have the desired accent; however there are issues in maintaining the identity of the speakers. We conclude with discussion on possible sources for the results and directions for future work.
