With the emergence of the use of technology in language learning through tools like Rosetta Stone and Duolingo, learners have slowly been given more autonomy of their language learning projection. Although these tools have allowed learners to tailor their learning to their own liking, there is a gap between the available resources to assist those that would like to improve their pronunciation. Previous research in the intersection of language learning and speech technology has made efforts to develop pronunciation training systems to address this problem, but the systems themselves tend to have gaps due to the lack of appropriate support for the users, especially in appropriately identifying errors and providing sufficient feedback to help them correct their errors.

Some researchers have purported that alongside other forms of feedback such as a visual articulatory representation, a voice conversion system could serve as a potential feedback mechanism by helping learners understand what their voice could sound like given the appropriate changes. However, like pronunciation training systems, voice conversion systems also faced many limitations due to the complex interaction of various features which made them unrenderable as useful tools.
With that said, recent advances in speech technology using methods such as i-vectors and deep neural networks have become increasingly successful in achieving better accuracy and quality in a variety of tasks, allowing for the potential to return and address these said gaps in performance for voice conversion.

This dissertation investigates these advancements in applying i-vectors and deep neural networks to develop an accent conversion system (a modified voice conversion system) that could potentially serve as a feedback mechanism as a part of a larger computer-based pronunciation training system. I compare this methodology against baselines using more traditional features and conversion processes following the work of Aryal and Gutierrez (2014) among their other works, and evaluate using the responses of participants in a perceptual study. I conclude with a discussion of the current work and highlight some potential directions for future direction.
