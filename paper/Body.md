# Design and Methodology

"Video games are the future. From education and business, to art and entertainment, our industry brings together the most innovative and creative minds to create the most engaging, immersive and breathtaking experiences we´ve ever seen." - *Michael D. Gallager (President and CEO of the Entertainment Software Association)*

The video games market is regarded as being the fastest growing segment of the entertainment branch \cite{Hennig-Thurau2013} and current numbers heavily back this assessment: The yearly revenue for the global games market is estimated to be around 99 billion US$ in 2016\cite{NewZoo2016}, while digital games alone made over 35 billion Euros in last year. The CAGRS (compound annual growth rate) is being estimated to be around 7%, so breaking the 50 billion Euro barrier in 2020\cite{Statista2016a}. Mobile games alone are generating nearly 37 billion US$ in 2016 and are on their way to overtake the film industry as \cite{PWC2015} reports a yearly global box office revenue for 2015 sneaking up to 40 billion Euro and growing at just 5.7%. The gamer community consists of more than 2.1 billion people worldwide nowadays. \cite{NewZoo2016}

Entertainment company Sony has sold more than 40 million Playstation4 video game consoles since launching it in November 2013 \cite{Sony2016}, including the most successful gaming console launch of all times with selling more than one million devices in the first 24 hour \cite{ShuheiYoshida2013}.

And the old stereotype of the teenage male nerd gamer is not applicable any more with the average US male gamer being 35 years of age and his female counterpart clocking in at 44 years.\cite{ESA2016}

This massive success has turned the video games industry into playing a pivotal role in everyone´s daily life  \cite{ESA2016a} and inspired researchers all around the world to dig into it. \cite{Sun2016} investigate the effects of consumer heterogeneity on the video games market, \cite{Binken2009} look into the role of high quality software for hardware sales, while  \cite{Shankar2002} and \cite{Clements2005} concentrate on indirect network effects(e.g. hardware-software interdependencies). On the other hand \cite{Aoyama2003} approach gaming from a socio-cultural perspective. In their article \cite{Hennig-Thurau2013} introduce a conceptual framework for value creation in the video game industry and do place the gaming platform in the center of gravity, but there is no major focus on the determination of success factors for the gaming platforms themselves.

This seminar paper aims to fill this gap and provide a comprehensive, conceptual framework to answer the question: "Which ingredients turn a video game console into a successful platform for a specific target group?" To create this framework I will first lay out the foundations by introducing the gaming industry´s main characteristics, e.g. that it is a two-sided, hedonic market catering to different gamer personae as its target audience and experiences a regular soft reset every 5 to 7 years with the introduction of a new console generation.\cite{Gallagher2002}

I will then use the framework provided by \cite{Hennig-Thurau2013} as a starting point and expand it to establish a holistic picture of a video game platform (see figure \ref{fig:framework} using the current state of scientific research. To conclude this paper I will apply the framework onto the the "console war" of the seventh console generation and discuss if the Apple iPhone has to be identified as a successful gaming platform.

# Foundations

Researching success factors is a common scientific practice\cite{Leidecker1984} in other branches like the film industry \cite{Hennig-Thurau2001}, supply chain management \cite{Power2001} or software development \cite{Reel1999}, but not as common in video games research thus opening interesting research opportunities.

As a precondition to investigating the success factors of video game platforms we have to establish the characteristics of the video games industry. Video games and thus video game platforms are by definition hedonic products like movies !TODO (reference here!) as they deliver a multisensoric experience on an emotional level. The relevant criterion in the buyer´s decision process is to evaluate if the video game platform delivers a desirable experience. \cite{Hirschman1982}
