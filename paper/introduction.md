\chapter{Introduction}

Technology has continuously evolved to no bounds as witnessed by the current successes enjoyed by the use of neural networks and the power of current hardware, something perhaps predicted by Moore's Law who proclaimed that computing power would double once every 18 months (and then changed to 24 months) [CITE HERE]. [Mention something about AI here]


We see the effects of neural networks throughout many subareas in computer science, including that of natural language processing. In fact, if we take a look at the number of publications involving neural networks, it has exponentially compounded annually [CITE IMAGE HERE].

While technology has flourished and led to a number of new state-of-the-art systems such as improvements in commercial speech recognition and machine translation, it can be argued that these benefits have not reached and innovated other areas outside of research to the same extent. One such example that could benefit from modern innovations is education. Although there have been small trends here and there to create applications for educational use such as Duolingo for language learning[EXAMPLES?], in general it seems that education has not evolved at the same rate as tech. In particular, pronunciation has been a large standing challenge in language learning due to its complex nature. Unlike grammar and vocabulary pronunciation can be challenging to both learn and teach due to the lack of clarity on how to teach it. 


# Research Questions

In this thesis, I focus on investigating the following questions:

* How can we leverage recent advances in recent technologies (namely deep neural networks) to convert a speaker's voice into sounding like it was said with another accent?

* What specific methodologies achieve the best similarity to the target accent and produce the most natural sounding audio?

# Thesis Overview
The overview of the thesis is as follows:

In Chapter 2, I present the motivation for creating an accent converison system by discussing previous findings in second language acquisition research especially in relation to speech.
