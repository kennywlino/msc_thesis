\chapter{Introduction}

Technology has continuously evolved to no bounds as witnessed by the current successes enjoyed by the use of neural networks and the power of current hardware, something perhaps predicted by Moore's Law who proclaimed that computing power would double once every 18 months (and then changed to 24 months) [CITE HERE]. [Mention something about AI here]


We see the effects of neural networks throughout many subareas in computer science, including that of natural language processing. In fact, if we take a look at the number of publications involving neural networks, it has exponentially compounded annually [CITE IMAGE HERE].

While technology has flourished and led to a number of new state-of-the-art systems such as improvements in commercial speech recognition and machine translation, it can be argued that these benefits have not reached and innovated other areas outside of research to the same extent. One such example that could benefit from modern innovations is education. Although there have been small trends here and there to create applications for educational use such as Duolingo for language learning[EXAMPLES?], in general it seems that education has not evolved at the same rate as technology. In particular, pronunciation has been a large standing challenge in language learning due to its complex nature. Unlike grammar and vocabulary, pronunciation can be challenging to both learn and teach due to the lack of clarity on how to teach it. Like grammar and vocabulary, pronunciation also involves a number of nuanced characteristics, including stress, rhythm, vowels, and consonants.

The variation in these features contribute to what many known as _accent_, or variations in pronunciation across speakers based on location, ethnicities, social classes, native languages, etc. Accents can be considered to be a part of dialects, where users of the same language may have variations beyond pronunciation, such as usage in vocabulary or grammar. The line may often be blurred in everyday discussions and even in academic analyses as accent and dialect (as well as language) could be considered to be on a continuum, but for the sake of simplicity, I consider _accent_ to be variations in pronunciation in this work.


# Research Questions

In this thesis, I focus on investigating the following questions:

* How can we leverage recent advances in recent technologies (namely deep neural networks) to convert a speaker's voice into sounding like it was said with another accent?

* What specific methodologies achieve the best similarity to the target accent and produce the most natural sounding audio?

# Thesis Overview
The overview of the thesis is as follows:

In **Chapter 2**, I give a proper definition of voice conversion and accent conversion, and a high level overview of some technical details needed to better understand the current work.

In **Chapter 3**, I present the motivation for creating an accent converison system by discussing previous findings in second language acquisition research especially in relation to speech. I then cover previous work in voice and accent conversion to frame the advances and shortcomings of previously developed systems.

In **Chapter 4**, the design and methodology of the experiments are presented alongside the appropriate tools utilized to conduct each one. 

In **Chapter 5**, the results of the experiments previously described are presented along with some short discussion and conclusions drawn from the results. 

In **Chapter 6**, the thesis is concluded with a reflection on the work presented along with some appropriate suggestions for future work.
