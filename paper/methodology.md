\chapter{Design and methodology}

In this chapter, I introduce the dataset and tools utilized in the experiments, and detail the procedures carried out to conduct the accent conversion process.

# Data
The main dataset utilized in the following experiments is the ABI-1 corpus.


# Experiment 1: GMM-based accent conversion-- a reproduction of \textcite{aryal2014}

This experiment a) is to understand more traditional mapping methods used in voice/accent conversion and b) serves as a baseline to be compared to other innovative methods (e.g Experiment 2).


# Experiment 2: I-vector based accent conversion

This experiment is motivated by the works presented in \textcite{wu2016} and \textcite{kinnunen2017}. Due to their flexible nature, i-vectors are an appropriate method to capture the representation of an accent in a compact way
