# Erasmus Mundus Language and Communication Technologies Master's Thesis

## Contents

* Articles

In this folder, you can find the various articles referenced within the thesis itself. 
In *articles.bib*, you may find information about every article I downloaded as a potential reference. 
In the *files* folder, you may find a copy of each article's PDF; however this is organized following Zotero's 
(a reference management system), so it is a bit difficult to find each article. What can be said is that each article is contained in an individual article,
and should be able to be found by searching for the title/author using the system search.

* Experiments

In this folder, you can find the Jupyter Notebooks containing information the experiments.

* Paper

In this folder, you may find the individual parts of the thesis in Markdown format, including the introduction, literature review, experiments, etc.
However, the final compiled version is available in *output.pdf*, where you can see all of the markdown files combined into the official submission verison.

* Pipfile

The pipfile can be used to recreate the environments for the Jupyter Notebooks by using pipenv. With pipenv, it should be possible to go into this folder
and just run pipenv and the required packages should easily be installed.
