Organizing Thesis Survey

Corpus info
* 2 corpora
* 6 speakers per corpus (3 M, 3 F) --> 12 speakers in total
* 50 test utterances per speaker
* 600 test utterances in total

Evaluation Criteria
* Acoustic quality
** Mean opinion score of 1 to 5 (bad to excellent)
** 10 randomly chosen utterances

* Speaker identity
** Voice similarity score from -7 (definitely different speakers) to +7
** Utterances should be reversed
** 10 randomly chosen utterances

* Accentedness
** When When adding audio to those folders rename them to:
** Save the original name of the audio files to a text file
** SPEAKER_ID_GENDER_TEST_EVAL_CRITERIA_FILE#_.wav
** e.g. EAN_male_test_AQ_1.wav

n adding audio to those folders rename them to:
** Save the original name of the audio files to a text file
** SPEAKER_ID_GENDER_TEST_EVAL_CRITERIA_FILE#_.wav
** e.g. EAN_male_test_AQ_1.wav

Randomly chosen utterances

Survey structure
* 360 utterances to be evaluated
** 12 surveys with 30 audios (1 for each speaker)
** 6 surveys with 60 audios (30 audios from ABI, 30 audios from ARCTIC)

* When adding audio to those folders rename them to:
** Save the original name of the audio files to a text file
** SPEAKER_ID_GENDER_TEST_EVAL_CRITERIA_FILE#_.wav
** e.g. EAN_male_test_AQ_1.wav

* Organize audio into a folder for each eval criteria:

** Acoustic quality
*** 10 random audio files (can stay the same as currently chosen)

** Accentedness
*** 10 ABX groups of audio files; does converted audio sound more like A or B?
*** Randomize A and B between Source and Target speakers
*** e.g. GLA -> 1A, SSE -> 1B; SSE -> 2A, GLA -> 2B

** Speaker identity
*** 10 pairs of random audio files; should be counter-balanced and REVERSED
*** e.g. converted audio -> 1A, source -> 1B; source -> 2A, converted audio -> 2B
